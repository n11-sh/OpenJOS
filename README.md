*Java Linux*
Java Linux (aka Java OS) is an experimental Linux distribution that reimagines the userspace with Java. While the kernel remains Linux based in C, almost everything else, from system tools to core services, is built in Java. The goal is a modern, secure, and isolated OS environment, with simplicity and minimalism at its core.
This repository hosts the official website: HTML, CSS, and assets that showcase the project, its features, and updates.
